This is the first course in the series of graduate-level, large-scale, and rigorous mathematical programming courses taught by [Jon Lee](https://sites.google.com/site/jonleewebpage/). Topics include **Duality Theorems**, the mathematical rigorous **Simplex Algorithm**, **Complementary Slackness**, **Large-Scale Linear Programming**, **Sensitivity Analysis**, and **Integer Programming** with their applications.
> This course is not intended to teach you how to *hand-solve small-scale* linear programming problems, rather, it's intended to give a rigorous foundation for solving *large-scale* linear programming problems in an algorithmic way. We rely on `Python` and `Gurobi` for examples to solve various problems in the assignments.

#### Analysis of Social Networks (EECS544/EECS444) \[[📝](./SocNetAnalysis.pdf) | [$\LaTeX$](https://github.com/sleepymalc/Notes/tree/main/EECS544-Analysis-of-Social-Networks)\]

While focusing on real measures, we did discuss signed and complex measures for completeness.
> This course is pretty rigorous and well-structured and acts as a pre-request for [functional analysis (MATH 602)](#functional-analysis-math602). It's self-contained enough and only needs some previous exposure to mathematical analysis.

## Senior @University of Michigan

### Fall 2022[^1]

[^1]: I also took Nonlinear Programming (MATH663/IOE611), but the professor provided excellent lecture slides, so I won't bother scribing it myself.

This is a graduate-level functional analysis course taught by [Joseph Conlon](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~conlon/). The focus of this course is rather standard, including **Banach and Hilbert Spaces Theory**, **Bounded Linear, Compact, and Self-Adjoint Operators Theorem**, **Representation, Hahn-Banach, Open Mapping Theorem**, and **Spectral Theory**. We also covered some point-set topology along the way.
> A rigorous course gives you the needed tools for analyzing function spaces. It'll give you a solid understanding of infinite dimensional vector spaces and how to deal with operators over these spaces.

### Winter 2023

#### Introduction to Cryptography ([EECS475](https://mahdi.ch/eecs475/), TA) \[[📝](./Crypto.pdf)\]

Topics include the classical **Concentration Inequality**, **Expected Supremum of Empirical Process**, **Applications to M-Estimation**, and **Fixed Design Non-Parametric Regression**.
> This is one of the hardest courses I have taken due to how messy some calculations are and the common tricks used in theoretical statistics which I'm not familiar with. However, this is quite relevant to modern generalization theory for deep learning (actually a foundation), so I enjoy learning this course quite a lot.

### Spring 2024

#### Large Sample Theory (STAT575) \[[📝](./LargeSample.pdf) | [$\LaTeX$](https://github.com/sleepymalc/Notes/tree/main/STAT575-Large-Sample-Theory)\]
