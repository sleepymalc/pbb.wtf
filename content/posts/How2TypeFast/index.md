## Introduction

Do you think typing fast, i.e., achieving a high wpm (high word-per-minutes), is the only way to be efficient/productive? If you do, then this compact, 5-mins read post will blow your mind, making you *even faster*.[^1]

[^1]: In the sense of efficiency, go without saying.

### Mentality

What I'm going to share is not about how you can be fast in regular typesetting, e.g., achieving wpm 150 in [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com). Rather, it's about some of the most fundamental editing-related key remaps I have done.

> If you have read the post about [VSCode-LaTeX-Inkscape](../VSCode-LaTeX-Inkscape) and are still wondering how I can typeset these [notes](../Notes) in class, here it is: this is my only secret left.

Before walking through my key remaps one by one, I want to give you the mentality you should have when adapting my settings: Your hands should move **as little as possible**. You might already hear this multiple times, but you should bring this to an **extreme**, i.e., staying your hand on the main row (i.e., right index finger on `f`, left index finger on `j`) is the *bare minimum* you should achieve.

Let me ask you: *How do you typically delete a character?* If you

<p style="text-align: center;">use <code>delete</code> (<code>backspace</code>) with your right little finger traveling across 2 columns and 2 rows,</p>

then you should keep reading.

### Tool matters

First thing first, please get yourself a good keyboard. I use [HHKB](https://happyhackingkb.com/) Professional Hybrid Type-S personally. It's fast, elegant, and customizable. Moreover, the revolutionary layout is awesome.[^hhkb]

### The Setup

I will use macOS and [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) as our working example, but the same concept should be easily ported to other operating systems. The following is a snapshot of my setting.

<div align="center">
	<img width="80%" src="figures/Karabiner-Elements.png"/>
</div>

You can easily import these settings [at the end](#import-settings), which can be used as your own setting's starting point. Now, let's walk through them one by one.

## Use `right cmd`

Have you ever used your right `cmd`?

### Arrow Keys

I hope you use [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), or at least heard about it. If you're introducing [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) to others, the first thing you might say is that

<p style="text-align: center;">instead of using <code>←</code>/<code>↓</code>/<code>↑</code>/<code>→</code>, we now use <code>h</code>/<code>j</code>/<code>k</code>/<code>l</code> (in normal mode)!</p>

Now the question is, ***WHY***? Well, imagine you're editing texts, and want to change something 3 characters before the cursor, what should you do? Using arrow keys would be a natural choice if you're not in [Vim](https://www.vim.org/). But remember that your arrow keys are *far away* from the ***main row*** of your keyboard.

To address this, we simply adapt [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)'s solution, i.e., using `h`/`j`/`k`/`l` as arrow keys. However, unlike in [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) where we have *normal mode* and *insert mode* so using `h`/`j`/`k`/`l` as arrow keys in *normal mode* would not be a problem. Contrarily, we now need to maintain the ability to insert alphabets `h`/`j`/`k`/`l`. The solution is also simple: *use a modifier*. I use `right cmd`+`h`/`j`/`k`/`l` as `←`/`↓`/`↑`/`→`.

You might notice that I use the `right cmd` instead of just `cmd`. This is because `cmd`+`h`/`j`/`k`/`l` might be your other shortcuts, and entirely overloading them to arrow keys is not ideal. Hence, by specifying only `right cmd`+`h`/`j`/`k`/`l` as arrow keys, it

- preserve the potential shortcuts; and
- `right cmd`+`h`/`j`/`k`/`l` only uses your right hand which is very natural (you just need to press the `right cmd` with your right thumb, and you can use arrow keys just like you're in [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) **wherever you are**).

### Math-Related Characters

We saw that you can use your `right cmd` as a special modifier, and now we want to extend this theme. I typeset math-related characters quite often, e.g., `=`, `+`/`-`, `^`/`_`, `(`/`)`, `[`/`]`, and `{`/`}`. Most of them are on the top row and need a modifier (usually `shift`). And this is not very intuitive and still, some of them (e.g., `+`/`=` and `-`/`_`) are far from the main column (w.r.t. your little finger) and the main row. So, I use

1. `right cmd`+`g` for `=`;
2. `right cmd`+`e`/`c` for `+`/`-`;
3. `right cmd`+`r`/`v` for `^`/`_`;
4. `right cmd`+`d`/`f` for `(`/`)`;
5. `right cmd`+`a`/`s` for `{`/`}`;
6. `right cmd`+`q`/`w` for `[`/`]`;

Here is my justification for this setup:

- It's easy to type: All of them are around the main row of your left hand (and your right hand is only responsible for the `right cmd`).
- It's easy to remember: They're quite symmetric (e.g., `^` is `right cmd`+`r` while `_` is `right cmd`+`v`, up and down, respectively).
- It's more accurate: It's not easy to type `-`/`_` and `+`/`=` on the first try with your right little finger in the ordinary setup.
- It's more comfortable: The most frequently used characters, i.e., `^`/`_` and `+`/`-`, are configured to your index finger and middle finger, respectively.

## Long and Short Press

If you notice that some keys are only designed for long-press but never exploit it, then keep reading.

### Escape

Again, if you use [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), then you will need to use `esc` intensively. Hence, some might suggest you go remap the `caps lock` to `esc`.

However, in my case, I'm using [HHKB](https://happyhackingkb.com/), i.e., the usual position for `caps lock` is `control`.

<div align="center">
	<img width="80%" src="figures/hhkb-layout.png"/>
</div>

> To make thing consistent, I also remap `caps lock` on my MacBook to `control`.

So, should we directly remap `control` to `esc`? No! Observe that `control` is used as a modifier, i.e., you never click `control` on its own. By exploiting this fact, we can

<p style="text-align: center;">set <code>control</code> to be <code>esc</code> if it's pressed alone.</p>

Specifically, if I press `control` for less than a threshold called `alone threshold` (e.g., 0.15 seconds), then it'll be recognized as `esc`; and if I press `control` for more than a threshold called `hold-down threshold` (e.g., 0.04 seconds), then it'll be recognized as `control` and can then be used as a modifier.[^2]

[^2]: You might notice that it's possible to have conflict, i.e., if you press `control` for 0.1 seconds, then it'll trigger both `control` and `esc`. However, it's fine since `control` is a modifier but is not combined with `esc`. You don't want your `hold-down threshold` to be too long (e.g., 0.15 seconds to avoid conflict) because then whenever you want to use `control` as a modifier combined with other keys to trigger a shortcut, you'll need to hold `control` for that long.

### Left and Right Shift

Now we know we can use long press and single press separately, we can overload other modifiers in the same way as well! I do not go all the way to overload every modifier however; I only overload both `shift`s besides `control`.

> You might not want to do this for every modifier such as `opt` and `cmd` to be honest... It's very possible that you will accidentally trigger them when you're trying out what shortcut you're going to use (e.g., when you're copying things using `cmd`+`c`, it's possible to press `cmd` alone and release it when you realize you don't want to actually copy the selected texts).

For the `left shift`, I configure it as

<p style="text-align: center;"><code>caps lock</code> when <code>left shift</code> is pressed alone.</p>

This is because I'm bilingual, and I need to be able to switch the input language on the fly (actually the macOS default `caps lock` is the fastest way to switch the input language in my experience). So, I leave it as it is on the system level, and modify the `left shift` to be `caps lock` when it's pressed alone. It works quite well in practice.

For the `right shift`, I do something more crazy:

<p style="text-align: center;">when <code>right shift</code> is pressed alone, it acts as <code>delete</code> is pressed alone</p>

and,

<p style="text-align: center;">when <code>right shift</code> is pressed twice and is held on the second press, it acts as <code>delete</code> is held-down.</p>

The first one is clear: I don't want to reach my little finger to the usual `delete` spot since it's far away[^3], and it's natural to remap `delete` to the `right shift` since it's an easy reach for my right little finger.

[^3]: Also, on the [HHKB](https://happyhackingkb.com/) layout, the `delete` key is on the usual `|`/`\` key's spot, which is quite awkward for me. So I remap the `delete` on my [HHKB](https://happyhackingkb.com/) to `|`/`\` on the system level; this means, the `delete` key is now completely gone on my [HHKB](https://happyhackingkb.com/).

But there's a problem: you now can't hold `delete` for a consecutive deletion since holding it is equivalent to holding the `right shift`. To fix this, I come up with the above-mentioned solution, that is, you can trigger the hold-down action for `deletion` by

1. pressing `right shift` alone first, and
2. pressing `right shift` again and holding it.

Intuitive, right? That's all I want to share.

## Import Settings

To import others' settings in [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/), I don't know any easy (i.e., 1-click) way to do it. But the basic steps are as follows.

1. Open [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/), go to *Misc* and click on *Export & Import*.
    <div align="center">
		<img width="80%" src="figures/sourcecode-1.png"/>
	</div>
2. Copy [`Alone.json`](./How2TypeFast/Alone.json), [`Double.json`](./How2TypeFast/Double.json), [`Right-Cmd.json`](./How2TypeFast/Right-Cmd.json) into `.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications`.[^5]
    <div align="center">
		<img width="80%" src="figures/sourcecode-2.png"/>
	</div>
3. Again open [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/), go to *Complex Modifications* and click on *Add rule*.
	<div align="center">
		<img width="80%" src="figures/sourcecode-3.png"/>
	</div>
4. You should be able to enable these rules easily.
	<div align="center">
		<img width="80%" src="figures/sourcecode-4.png"/>
	</div>

[^5]: If you came from [VSCode-LaTeX-Inkscape](./VSCode-LaTeX-Inkscape#karabiner-elements), then you add [`Inkscape.json`](./How2TypeFast/Inkscape.json) into `.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications`.

Finally, you can also set up your *Parameters* as mine:

<div align="center">
	<img width="80%" src="figures/parameter.png"/>
</div>
