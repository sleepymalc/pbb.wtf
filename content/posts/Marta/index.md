## 🦊 Marta - A Finder Alternative 🦊

<div align="center">
	<img width="80%" src="figures/marta.png"/>
</div>

Though most of the native apps made by excellent Apple engineers are easy to use[^1], [Finder](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201732) is different. I asked lots of my macOS friends, and nearly all of them think [Finder](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201732) is great, "*it's fast and easy to use.*" Every time I heard about this, I doubt they haven't seen [TotalFinder](https://totalfinder.binaryage.com/) before.
> Although I can write another paragraph introducing [TotalFinder](https://totalfinder.binaryage.com/) to you, but sadly, while Apple is moving on to arm architecture, [TotalFinder](https://totalfinder.binaryage.com/) couldn't keep up with the pace to be compatible with Apple. Indeed, it stops updating and not maintained anymore.[^2]

[^1]: Even if it's not the case, there are at least some alternatives.
[^2]: But it's now free though... 😂

## Why Marta?

<div>
    <img src="figures/icon-hand-draw.png" align="right"/>
</div>

The fundamental difference between [TotalFinder](https://totalfinder.binaryage.com/) and [Finder](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201732) is the **multiple tabs support** and the **double-panel** feature, which allows you to manage files *purely by the keyboard*. If you're using Finder, you'll need multiple windows and probably a mouse to achieve this, but now you can do the same thing with only one active window.

Though [TotalFinder](https://totalfinder.binaryage.com/) is no longer available for Arm Mac, [Marta](https://marta.sh/) appeared. It's better in some ways compared to [TotalFinder](https://totalfinder.binaryage.com/), but not that convenient in others. Nevertheless, it's *free*, *natively supported*, and most importantly, *it's cute*! The author of [Marta](https://marta.sh/) [Yan Zhulanow](https://yanex.org/): "This cute fox stands for quick and smart, just like [Marta](https://marta.sh/)".

> If you ask, "*Ok, so what? You can use arrow keys moving around in [Finder](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201732) too!*" Well, then in this case, [Finder](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201732) may be sufficient for your usage.

## Features

I'm going to briefly introduce some basic but powerful features of [Marta](https://marta.sh/). For the full documentation, please check the official [docs](https://marta.sh/docs/) for reference. First, this is the basic look of your Marta window:

<div align="center">
	<img width="80%"src="figures/demo.png"/>
</div>

### Actions

The core functionality in [Marta](https://marta.sh/) is given as *action*, which can be realized as commands and can be triggered with shortcuts. There are enormous amounts of *actions* provided, and all of them can be arbitrarily combined with your favorite keybindings and triggered effortlessly.

### Search Actions

You might sometimes get lost when you are working with [Marta](https://marta.sh/) since there are so many *actions* that can be used, and you have many keybindings to each of them. But don't worry, there is a very nice feature provided natively in [Marta](https://marta.sh/) that helps you find any *action* in no time: that is the *Search Action*.

When you press `shift`+`cmd`+`p`, a search bar named *Search Action* will pop up, and you can search for any *action* you want to use. For example, there is a built-in `Compress` *action* in [Marta](https://marta.sh/), but since I didn't compress files that often, I do not assign a keybinding to this. Do not panic if you suddenly want to compress some files! You can select files[^3] you want to zip and then press `shift`+`cmd`+`p`, search for `Compress` and use `enter` to trigger the action:

[^3]: To select multiple files, you select them by using `shift`+`↑`/`↓` as expected.

<div align="center">
	<img width="80%" src="gifs/search-action.gif"/>
</div>

Now, let's start binding some useful *actions* to your favorite keybindings!

### Navigating

In Finder, you can use arrow keys to navigate through folders, namely

* `←` : Move to the parent folder.
* `→` : Move to the folder if the current focus is on a folder (otherwise do nothing).
* `↑` : Move up.
* `↓` : Move down.

You can do not only the same but more with [Marta](https://marta.sh/)! The definition of the right key in [Marta](https://marta.sh/) in default is the `core.move.right` *action*

```JSON
"Right" "core.move.right"
```

which essentially does the same thing as in Finder. But rather, you can redefine (yes, you can **completely redefine** all the keybindings) it into `core.open` *action* by

```JSON
"Right" "core.open"
```

which can not only bring you into that folder, but if your current focus is on a file, you can also open it! This makes life much easier.
> If you want to open a file in Finder, you'll need to use `cmd`+`o` instead.

One thing that is worth mentioning is that [Marta](https://marta.sh/) set `←` as `core.move.left`, which is a bit awkward if you are used to Finder. So instead, I changed it to

```JSON
"Left" "core.go.up"
```

which essentially does the same thing as Finder.

### Create New Files & Folders

By default, you can create folders and **any** type of file in [Marta](https://marta.sh/) by the following `new.folder` and `new.file` *actions*:

```JSON
"F7" 		"core.new.folder"
"Shift+F7" 	"core.new.file"
```

You can bind it to your favorite keybindings to match your own habits. For me, since [TotalFinder](https://totalfinder.binaryage.com/) follows the same shortcut as Finder, I changed it to

```JSON
"Shift+Cmd+n"   "core.new.folder"
"Shift+Cmd+f"   "core.new.file"
```

while `shift`+`cmd`+`n` is the default shortcut to create a new folder in Finder, but there is no such shortcut, or I should say, there is no easy way to create a new file in Finder, hence you get another useful shortcut! The following demo will show you how to create a new folder and a simple `.txt` file.

<div align="center">
	<img width="80%" src="gifs/create-new-file.gif"/>
</div>

### Find

A very clever move for [Marta](https://marta.sh/) is that they implemented some sort of fast searching. There are two kinds of search you can do in [Marta](https://marta.sh/), one is *local search*, and another is *global search*.

#### Local Search

If your current folder contains lots of files, you can locate any file you want quickly by ***directly typing their name***. Let me show you how to do this.

<div align="center">
	<img width="80%" src="gifs/local-search.gif"/>
</div>

This is extremely fast and clever!
> Note that [Finder](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201732) does support this feature, but it does not do well in some cases. Marta does it more consistent and intuitively.

#### Global Search

What if you want to go to other directories far from your current one? You can use the function `Look UP`, which is triggered by `cmd`+`p`. After you type this keybinding, a search bar will pop up, and you can search for the place you want to go to. Notice that it can be either a file or a directory.

<div align="center">
	<img width="80%" src="gifs/global-search.gif"/>
</div>

Now, after locating the file/folder, the next question is, how to open them?

### Open

As we mentioned before, we can open the file by `→`, but there is some subtly here, let me explain.

#### Open With

Interestingly, as you're going to see, [Marta](https://marta.sh/) lets you go *directly into* a `.zip` file and see the content in it with the `core.open` *action*. What if you want to do something else about it? Like, open it by other apps to unzip it?

Thankfully, we have the `core.open.with` *action* by default:

```JSON
"Cmd`+`Return" "core.open.with"
```

This allows you to open a file with different apps. Personally, I use [Keka](https://www.keka.io/en/), which is a portable, powerful but lightweight file archiver. Say I just zipped the newly created `text.txt` file and want to unzip it, I can press `cmd`+`Return`, and search for the app I want to open this file with. In this case, I want to open `test.txt.zip` with [Keka](https://www.keka.io/en/):

<div align="center">
	<img width="80%" src="gifs/open.gif"/>
</div>

#### Edit

For developers, I bet you'll need to open an **entire folder** very often. And as far as I know, there is no easy way to do this in Finder. But in [Marta](https://marta.sh/), you can use the `core.edit` *action*:

```JSON
"F4" "core.edit"
```

As you might already observe, I tend to define my keybinding with the keyword's first alphabet being the same as the first alphabet of the functionality this keybinding stands for. Hence, rather than remember this weird `F4` functional key, I use `cmd`+`e` to do the `core.edit` *action*:

```JSON
"Cmd+e" "core.edit"
```

What `core.edit` is really doing is that after you specify a **text editor**, which you can specify in the configuration file, it'll open whatever you're focusing on within that app.[^4] For example, I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my primary editor, so I define

[^4]: That's to say, you can also open a file with the **text editor** you specified.

```JSON
environment {
    textEditor "Visual Studio Code"
}
```

So, if you now want to open a project, you can simply press `cmd`+`e`, then it'll open this folder within your favorite IDE you specified! Let's see the demo.

<div align="center">
	<img src="gifs/edit.gif"/>
</div>

#### Preview

You might already notice, that [Marta](https://marta.sh/) doesn't provide rich support of figures as your visual tool for file organization. But as in Finder, you can always press `space` to open/close a quick *preview* (it's formally called *quick look*) to see what this file is. This works like this.

<div align="center">
	<img src="gifs/quick-look.gif"/>
</div>

> I need to admit, the preview column provided by [Finder](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201732) is quite useful in some cases...

### Double Panels

If you have followed all these until now, you might have one question: "So when does the core feature - *Double Panels* come into play?" Here it comes, it's useful in the following two ways

1. Tabs (Pages) support.
2. ***Move your files around***.

This is the most complex section, hence I leave it to the very end. We start by introducing tabs.

#### Tabs

For short, you can open several tabs in *each* panel. And with one of the essential shortcuts to navigate in the [Marta](https://marta.sh/), `tab``, which essentially will send you to another panel, you can achieve the following.

<div align="center">
	<img width="80%" src="gifs/tabs.gif"/>
</div>

Yes, it's simple but powerful! In the demo, I use `cmd`+`t` to create a new tab while using `cmd`+`w` to close it. Further, I use `opt`+`cmd`+`←` and `opt`+`cmd`+`→` to navigate between tabs. With this in mind, we now see how you can utilize this to speed up the process of moving files around.

#### Copy & Pasting

The default behavior is just like any other file managers you are familiar with, i.e., `cmd`+`c` for copying, and `cmd`+`v` for pasting. But I have done one tweak related to copy: I assign `opt`+`cmd`+`c` to copy the *path* of the current focus file/folder by combining this keybinding with `core.path` as follows:

```JSON
"Cmd+Opt+c" "core.path"
```

This is quite useful and fast!

#### Move (Cut-like)

In case some of you didn't know, [Finder](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201732) **does** provide the functionality `cut`. This is done by first using `cmd`+`c` like `copy`, and instead of using `cmd`+`v`, you use `Opt+cmd`+`v` to cut the selected content and paste them to where you want.
> So basically, in Finder, you can first use `cmd`+`c` to copy the selected files, and then determine whether you want to past or cut them until the very end.

[Marta](https://marta.sh/), on the other hand, **doesn't** provide such an *action*. It only provides `core.move`, and the way it's done is like following.

1. Select the file you want to `core.move`.
2. Press the keybinding you assign to `core.move` (default is `F6`, I reassign it to be `cmd`+`x`).
3. Type the path you want to `core.move` the selected files (can include folders). The default path is ***another panel (current tab)'s path***.

For demonstration, say I want to move the created `Test/test.txt` to my `Test2` folder. The workflow should be like this:

<div align="center">
	<img width="80%" src="gifs/move.gif"/>
</div>

#### Clone

As you can see, [Marta](https://marta.sh/) wants you to handle your file reorganization by utilizing its **double-panel** feature. So, there must be a way to create a tab on the other side of your panel quickly, maybe? Indeed! It's exactly the `clone`-related *actions*, which include four variations:

1. `core.clone.left` (only works when you're at the *right* panel)

    It'll set the *left* panel to the **folder** you selected. If your current focus is on **file**, it'll simply set the *left* panel as the folder you're currently in.
2. `core.clone.right` (only works when you're at the *left* panel)

    Same as `core.clone.left`, but reversed in an obvious way.
3. `core.clone.left.folder` (only works when you're at the *right* panel)

    Almost the same as `core.clone.left`, but it'll ***always*** set the *left* panel as the folder you're currently in.
4. `core.clone.right.folder` (only works when you're at the *left* panel)

    Same as `core.clone.left.folder`, but reversed in an obvious way.

Now, if you're moving files around under some parent folder, then you can use `core.clone` *action* to quickly set another panel to a similar path and `core.move` files around fast.

## Personal Configuration

Let's see the configuration file. To open the configuration file, you can simply press `cmd`+`,`. To apply all my configurations, copy the following codes into the **Right** panel of the configuration file.
> The left-hand side of the configuration file is the default config for reference.

```JSON
behavior {
    theme "Kon"

    actions {
        core.trash.confirm false

        core.lookup.mode "substring"
    }

    table {
        circularSelection true
        iconSize 24
    }
}

keyBindings {
    "Return"        "core.rename"
    "Right"         "core.open"
    "Left"          "core.go.up"

    "Shift+Cmd+n"   "core.new.folder"
    "Shift+Cmd+f"   "core.new.file"

    "Cmd+e"         "core.edit"
    "Shift+Cmd+x"   "core.move.inactive"
    "Cmd+o"         "core.open"
    "Cmd+x"         "core.move"
    "Cmd+Opt+c"     "core.path"

    "Shift+Cmd+t"   "core.terminal.activate"

    "F4"            null
    "F6"            null
    "F7"            null
    "Shift+F7"      null
    "F8"            null
    "Cmd+y"         null
    "Backspace"     null

    "Cmd+Opt+Right" "core.tab.next"
    "Cmd+Opt+Left"  "core.tab.previous"
}

environment {
    textEditor "Visual Studio Code"
}

setup {
    actionBar [
        "core.edit"
        "core.open"
        "core.open.with"
        "core.rename"
        "core.new.folder"
        "core.new.file"
        "core.trash"
        "core.preview"
    ]
}

etty {
    theme "SolarizedLight"
    fonts {
        normal [ "Fira Code" 12]
    }
}
```

## Theme

One thing I didn't bring up is that there are actually different themes you can choose from, here are some from the [official document](https://marta.sh/docs/configuration/themes/):

1. Kon

<div align="center">
	<img width="80%" src="figures/kon.png"/>
</div>

2. Dark

<div align="center">
	<img width="80%" src="figures/dark.png"/>
</div>

3. Classic

<div align="center">
	<img width="80%" src="figures/classic.png"/>
</div>

4. Sakura 🌸

<div align="center">
	<img width="80%" src="figures/sakura.png"/>
</div>

I actually quite like the look of Sakura 🌸, but since I use dark mode as my main theme, I just give up on this... Try it out! To change the theme, you can either just change the `tmeme` (the first line in my [personal configuration](#personal-configuration)) in the configuration file, or search the `Switch Theme` *action*:

<div align="center">
	<img width="80%" src="gifs/switch-theme.gif"/>
</div>

## Conclusion

Overall, I think [Marta](https://marta.sh/) provides excellent customization abilities, while still being easy enough for simple use. If you think you need an extra boost of productivity, or even just want to try out new applications, [Marta](https://marta.sh/) is definitely worth giving a shot!

## Alternatives

Here, I'm going to list some alternatives to Finder, you can try them yourself!

1. [TotalFinder](https://totalfinder.binaryage.com/)

   Just found out that the [TotalFinder](https://totalfinder.binaryage.com/) is back! See the [discussion thread](https://discuss.binaryage.com/t/update-discussion-totalfinder-1-14-2-for-apple-silicon-and-intel/8364) to see how to download it!
   >But a big *caveat* is that: It still requires you to disable [SIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Integrity_Protection), see [this](https://totalfinder.binaryage.com/apple-silicon). I genuinely **don't care**, but now things are different: in arm mac, disable [SIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Integrity_Protection) will cause some problem, see [here](https://totalfinder.binaryage.com/apple-silicon#mark-important-disabling-sip-in-any-capacity-even-partially-will-also).
   > <div align="center">
   > <img src="figures/SIP.png"/>
   > </div>

2. [QSpaces](https://qspace.awehunt.com/en-us/index.html)

    Another powerful [Finder](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201732) alternative. It basically can do what [Marta](https://marta.sh/) is capable of but with a better (well, complicated) GUI. I still prefer [Marta](https://marta.sh/) after trying this, but definitely check it out if you're interested.
