Though I'm quite satisfied showing my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/sleepymalc), it turns out that I have much more to show. For example, GitHub is extremely unfriendly to show `.pdf` files since the internal link (we call it $\texttt{hyperlink}$ for those $\LaTeX$ freaks) doesn't work. This kind of problem arises quite often. Besides, my only hobby these days is *photographing*, and as you can imagine, it's awkward to show your photos there...

Apart from all these, since I use $\LaTeX$ a **lot**, the only way I know how to render $\LaTeX$ formulas on GitHub is *ugly* with a bunch of limitations. Hence, this pushed me to build this website eventually. To demonstrate, we can easily print out some beautiful formulas like $$ \lim\limits_{r \to 0} \frac{1}{m(B(x, r))}\int_{B(x, r)}\left\vert f(y) - f(x) \right\vert\,\mathrm{d}y = 0 \text{ for a.e. \(x\)} $$ for $f\in L^1$.[^1]
